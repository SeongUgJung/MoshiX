Changelog
=========

Version 0.6.0
-------------

_2020-10-30_

#### moshi-sealed

`@TypeLabel` now has an optional `alternateLabels` array property for cases where multiple labels 
can match the same sealed subtype.

```kotlin
@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, generator = "sealed:type")
sealed class Message {

  @TypeLabel("success", alternateLabels = ["successful"])
  @JsonClass(generateAdapter = true)
  data class Success(val value: String) : Message()
}
```

**NOTE:** We also changed `@TypeLabel`'s `value` property to the more meaningful `label` name. This 
is technically a breaking change, but should be pretty low impact since most people wouldn't be 
defining this parameter name or reading the property directly.

Version 0.5.0
-------------

_2020-10-25_

Dependency updates for all code generation artifacts:
* KSP `1.4.10-dev-experimental-20201023`
* KotlinPoet `1.7.2`

#### moshi-ksp

* Use KSP's new `asMemberOf` API for materializing type parameters, allowing us to remove a lot of ugly
  `moshi-ksp` code that existed to accomplish the same.
* Defer failing the compilation when errors are reported to the `KSPLogger` until the end of the KSP run,
  allowing reporting all errors rather than just the first.

#### moshi-sealed

`moshi-sealed-codegen` and `moshi-sealed-codegen-ksp` now generate proguard rules for generated adapters
on the fly, matching Moshi's new behavior introduced in 1.10.0.

Thanks to [@plnice](https://github.com/plnice) for contributing to this release.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

_2020-10-12_

Updated Moshi to 1.11.0

#### moshi-ksp

Updated to `1.4.10-dev-experimental-20201009`

#### moshi-ktx

Removed! These APIs live in Moshi natively now as of 1.11.0

#### moshi-adapters

New artifact!

First adapter in this release is a new `@JsonString` qualifier + adapter, so you can 
capture raw JSON content from payloads. This is adapted from the recipe in Moshi.

```Kotlin
val moshi = Moshi.Builder()
  .add(JsonString.Factory())
  .build()

@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true)
data class Message(
  val type: String,
  /** Raw JSON string for the `data` key. */
  @JsonString val data: String
)
```

Get it via

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("dev.zacsweers.moshix:moshi-adapters:<version>")
}
```

#### moshi-sealed

New support for multiple `object` subtypes. This allows for sentinel types who only contain an indicator
label but no other data.

In the below example, we have a `FunctionSpec` that defines the signature of a function and a
`Type` representations that can be used to model its return type and parameter types. These are all
`object` types, so any contents are skipped in its serialization and only its `type` key is read
by the `PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory` to determine its type.

```kotlin
@JsonClass(generateAdapter = false, generator = "sealed:type")
sealed class Type(val type: String) {
  @TypeLabel("void")
  object VoidType : Type("void")
  @TypeLabel("boolean")
  object BooleanType : Type("boolean")
  @TypeLabel("int")
  object IntType : Type("int")
}

data class FunctionSpec(
 val name: String,
 val returnType: Type,
 val parameters: Map<String, Type>
)
```

**NOTE**: As part of this change, the `moshi-sealed-annotations` artifact was replaced with a
`moshi-sealed-runtime` artifact. Please update your coordinates accordingly, and don't use `compileOnly`
anymore.

Version 0.3.2
-------------

_2020-10-01_

Fixes two issues with `moshi-ksp`:
- Handle `Any` superclasses when the supertype is from another module
- Filter out non-`CLASS` kinds from supertypes

Special thanks to [@JvmName](https://github.com/JvmName) for reporting and helping debug this!

Version 0.3.1
-------------

_2020-09-30_

`moshi-ksp` now fully supports nullable generic types, which means it is now at feature parity with
Moshi's annotation-processor-based code gen ðŸ¥³

Version 0.3.0
-------------

_2020-09-27_

### THIS IS BIG

This project is now **MoshiX** and contains multiple Moshi extensions.

* **New:** [moshi-ksp](https://github.com/ZacSweers/MoshiX/blob/main/moshi-ksp/README.md) - A [KSP](https://github.com/google/ksp) implementation of Moshi Kotlin Codegen.
* **New:** [moshi-ktx](https://github.com/ZacSweers/MoshiX/blob/main/moshi-ktx/README.md) - Kotlin extensions for Moshi with no kotlin-reflect requirements and fully compatible with generic reified types via the stdlib's `typeOf()` API.
* **New:** [moshi-metadata-reflect](https://github.com/ZacSweers/MoshiX/blob/main/moshi-metadata-reflect/README.md) - A [kotlinx-metadata](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/libraries/kotlinx-metadata/jvm) based implementation of `KotlinJsonAdapterFactory`. This allows for reflective Moshi serialization on Kotlin classes without the cost of including kotlin-reflect.
* **Updated:** [moshi-sealed](https://github.com/ZacSweers/MoshiX/blob/main/moshi-sealed/README.md) - Largely unchanged, but now there is a new `moshi-sealed-ksp` artifact available for KSP users.

Some of these will eventually move to Moshi directly. This project going forward is a focused set of extensions that 
either don't belong in Moshi directly or can be a non-API-stable testing ground for early adopters.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

_2020-04-26_

* Fix reflect artifact depending on a snapshot Moshi version.
* Update to Kotlin 1.3.72
* Update to KotlinPoet 1.5.0

Version 0.1.0
-------------

_2019-10-29_

Initial release!
